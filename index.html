                <div id="content1">
                    <p>In 2010, there was a discovery of
                        <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction()">LNG
                            <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup">Liquefied Natural Gas</span>
                        </span>
                        reserves in the north of Mozambique. The discovery brought a huge influx of Foreign Direct Investment
                        into the country over the past 10 years. Multinational enterprises (MNE) from all over the world
                        (such as the USA, China, and
                        India) have been investing billions of dollars into these reserves in Mozambique. However, most
                        of these foreign investors in Mozambique use letterbox companies in tax havens (such as the
                        United
                        Arab Emirates and Mauritius) to take advantage of the tax treaties that Mozambique has with
                        these
                        countries. These treaties were signed before the discovery of the LNG reserves and contain very
                        unfavorable conditions for Mozambique. Because of this, Mozambique’s ability to tax the income
                        generated by these investments is being threatened.</p>

                        <p>A <b>tax treaty</b>, also called double tax agreement (DTA) is a treaty or agreement between two
                            countries in which those countries agree on how to coordinate the levying of their taxes
                            with
                            the main objective of preventing international double taxation as well as tax avoidance. Tax

                            is very easy to set up letterbox companies; these letterbox companies take advantage of the

                            found there. This letterbox company is managed in a completely different place. You won’t
                            find most letterbox companies in Germany or the USA. Rather, in most cases they have an

                        <p>MNE’s are always looking for a way to make money, rather than spend it. A way in which money
                            can be saved is by playing with tax, either trying to pay less or to avoid it at all. Some
                            countries have a beneficial tax treaty with Mozambique. They do not need to cheat with their numbers,
                            they already get the gas at a low price. The countries that do not have that tax treaty also want

                            since more and more countries are avoiding paying that tax, Mozambique misses out on a lot
                            of money. That is why this problem needs to be solved.</p>

                        <p>Mozambique’s tax treaty network is a major tax leak for the country. Mozambique has signed tax
                            treaties with two of the world’s most notorious tax havens: Mauritius and the United Arab
                            Emirates. In the years 2015 to 2020, Mozambique lost overestimated $1 billion in withholding
                            taxes on interest payments and dividends as a result of its tax treaties. This is much needed
                            tax revenue that the country can really use.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>The advice to the Government of Mozambique is to immediately renegotiate the treaties with the
                            UAE and Mauritius (and other countries to). The tax treaties need to be beneficial for both
                            sides. This way, Mozambique gets the money that it deserves. Money that can be spend wisely, on
                            hospitals, schools and other public infrastructure.</p>
