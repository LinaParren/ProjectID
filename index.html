                    <p>In 2010, there was a discovery of

                        reserves in the north of Mozambique. The discovery brought a huge influx of

                        into the country over the past 10 years. Multinational enterprises (MNE) from all over the world
                        (such as the USA, China, and
                        India) have been investing billions of dollars into these reserves in Mozambique. However, most
                        of these foreign investors in Mozambique use letterbox companies in tax havens (such as the
                        United
                        Arab Emirates and Mauritius) to take advantage of the tax treaties that Mozambique has with
                        these
                        countries. These treaties were signed before the discovery of the LNG reserves and contain very
                        unfavorable conditions for Mozambique. Because of this, Mozambique’s ability to tax the income
                        generated by these investments is being threatened.</p>

                        <p>A tax treaty, also called double tax agreement (DTA) is a treaty or agreement between two
                            countries in which those countries agree on how to coordinate the levying of their taxes
                            with
                            the main objective of preventing international double taxation as well as tax avoidance. Tax
                            treaties are part of tax law and, more specifically, international tax law.</p>

                        <p>A tax haven is a country that offers foreign businesses minimal or no tax liability for their
                            bank deposits in a politically and economically stable environment. In these tax havens it
                            is very easy to set up letterbox companies; these letterbox companies take advantage of the
                            tax

                        <p>A letterbox company is a company that usually only exists on paper. This means that there is
                            a letterbox at the specified business location, but no office or business premises can be
                            found there. This letterbox company is managed in a completely different place. You won’t
                            find most letterbox companies in Germany or the USA. Rather, in most cases they have an
                            address abroad like Luxembourg, The Netherlands or countries outside of Europe.</p>

                    <p>MNE’s are always looking for a way to make money, rather than spend it. A way in which money can
                        be saved is by playing with tax, either trying to pay less or to avoid it at all. Some countries
                        have a beneficial tax treaty with Mozambique. They don't need to cheat with their numbers, they
                        already get the gas at a low price. The countries that don't have that tax treaty also want to
                        profit. They do that by setting up a letterbox company, in a country that has a beneficial tax
                        treaty. Since the company is registered in that country, it pays tax according to what is
                        determined in the treaty of that country. Because of the beneficial tax treaty of that country,
                        the company saves a lot of money.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Many companies get their goods from Mozambique this way, saving a lot of money for themselves.
                        But they are keeping that money from Mozambique, even tho the country can use it very much. If
                        there were only a few countries profiting from the beneficial tax treaties, Mozambique would
                        still make a lot of money from all the other countries that are buying goods from them. But
                        since more and more countries are avoiding paying that tax, Mozambique misses out on a lot of
                        money. That is why this problem needs to be solved.</p>

                    <p>Estimating the exact amount of money Mozambique loses to tax treaties that are not properly
                        drafted is complicated, since the available data is often not correct nor complete. The
                        situation is also worsened by Mozambique itself, as it is not carrying out regular assessments
                        of the tax revenue that is lost to individual investments (which are benefitting from tax
                        incentives). However, there is an estimated amount known about the losses in 2014. According to
                        data presented by the IMF, Mozambique lost the equivalent of 3.3% of GDP in potential tax
                        revenue to tax incentives. The same year, World Bank data says Mozambique’s annual GDP was
                        $16.87bn. So, losses to tax incentives for that year would have been $556.71m.</p>

                <div id="content6">
                    <p>Mozambique’s tax treaty network is a major tax leak for the country. Mozambique has signed tax
                        treaties with two of the world’s most notorious tax havens: Mauritius and the United Arab
                        Emirates. In the years 2015 to 2020, Mozambique lost overestimated $1 billion in withholding
                        taxes on interest payments and dividends as a result of its tax treaties. This is much needed
                        tax revenue that the country can really use.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The advice to the Government of Mozambique is to immediately renegotiate the treaties with the
                        UAE and Mauritius (and other countries to). The tax treaties need to be beneficial for both
                        sides. This way, Mozambique gets the money that it deserves. Money that can be spend wisely, on
                        hospitals, schools and other public infrastructure.</p>
